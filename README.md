### Hi there, I'm RadhikaðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Radhika Gupte, a passionate AI/ML Engineer at Mirro.ai with a recently completed Master of Science in Computer Science from Oregon State University. With a robust foundation in software engineering and a keen interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, I am dedicated to developing innovative solutions that enhance user experience and improve lives. 

At Mirro.ai, I focus on building intelligent systems that leverage the power of AI to provide insightful and efficient solutions. Recently, I developed a transcription service that enhances accessibility by converting audio/video files into text with high accuracy and reliability using an AI model. 

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at DAT Freight & Analytics, enhancing mobile application efficiency and code coverage through RESTful web services and automated tests. Before my MS, I was a Software Engineer at L&T Infotech Ltd. (now LTIMindtree), developing web services for a net banking application and an E-commerce web application using Angular, Java, and Spring Boot. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Oregon State University, I mentored students in Software Engineering, Operating Systems, and Introduction to Engineering, with projects like TourSmart and NetReconner, showcasing my ability to design and develop application that solve real-world problems.

I offer strong programming skills in Java, Python, Kotlin, and JavaScript, and I am proficient with frontend and backend frameworks such as React, Angular, Node.js, and Spring. My technical expertise extends to databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB, and cloud platforms including AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest technologies. I am looking forward to connecting with professionals and exploring opportunities that encourage me to build solutions that have a positive impact on the lives of people.
